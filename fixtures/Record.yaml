      I would diagnose you with pneumonia. Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs
      that can cause inflammation and damage to the air sacs and alveoli. This can
      lead to difficulty breathing, chest pain, fever, coughing, and fatigue. Your
      doctor may choose to prescribe antibiotics to help fight off the bacteria causing
      your pneumonia or may recommend other treatments such as rest, fluids, and physical
      therapy depending on the severity of your condition. It is important to seek
      medical attention promptly if you experience any symptoms associated with pneumonia
      so that appropriate treatment can be provided in a timely manner."
